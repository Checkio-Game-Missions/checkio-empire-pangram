A pangram (Greek:παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") or holoalphabetic sentence for a given alphabet is a
sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. 
Perhaps you are familiar with the well known pangram "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".

But we've found one interesting usage of pangrams -- we are using them to train our sniper focus.
